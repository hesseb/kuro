A small game developed for the chipKIT Uno32 board + chipKIT Basic I/O shield mainly in C with some touches of MIPS Assembly. Please notice the game needs the MCB32 toolchain to compile and can only be run on the specific Uno32 board. The aim of this repository is to be a portfolio of sorts and give an idea of how I code.

Sample gameplay can be seen here:
